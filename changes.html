                        <li>
                          <code>(!)</code> Fixed bug that prevented AutomateIt from working without the Builder gem&apos;s &quot;blankslate&quot; library. This fix should completely eliminate AutomateIt&apos;s dependence on Builder and ActiveSupport, like 0.71230 was supposed to do. This error was missed because other gems provide a &quot;blankslate&quot;-workalike and thus merely uninstalling Builder wasn&apos;t enough to confirm the previous fix.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <code>(+)</code> Improved PackageManager::Gem, it can now use commands other than &quot;gem&quot; to manage RubyGem packages, such as &quot;gem1.8&quot;. It now detects the best available command, but also lets you specify a default or choose one on a per-call basis. See the PackageManager::Gem documentation for examples. Comments are sought on the new syntax.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Improved PackageManager#_list_normalizer, it now accepts comments mid-way through a line and can parse arrays of strings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Updated misc/setup_rubygems.sh, a simple shell script that downloads and install RubyGems 1.0.1, useful for bootstrapping a system to get AutomateIt running on it.

                        <li>
                          <code>(!)</code> Removed all code that relied on the ActiveSupport and Builder libraries. The new, AutomateIt-specific replacements for these libraries are guaranteed to work correctly and load much more quickly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <code>(!)</code> Removed the &quot;--to-xml&quot; option from &quot;aitag&quot; and &quot;aifield&quot;. If anyone relied on this functionality, post to the mailing list and I&apos;ll write a replacement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <code>(%)</code> Fixed PlatformManager::LSB, it no longer converts OS release versions like &quot;7.10&quot; into &quot;7.1&quot;.

                        <li>
                          <code>(%)</code> Fixed &quot;aitags&quot; with &quot;--tags&quot; options, it now returns a sorted array instead of a set.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                          <code>(%)</code> Fixed TemplateManager#render, it now only runs file-related checks when rendering to a file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Improved PackageManager::CPAN&apos;s &quot;cpan_wrapper.pl&quot;. It&apos;s now just a single file that can be used as both a command and library.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Improved EditManager. In preview mode, it now checks to make sure the file is readable, rather than failing due to permission denied errors.

It now provides a workaround to activate CPAN if it wasn&apos;t already configured, previously it&apos;d hang as CPAN tried to get input. It now provides a workaround for rejecting all CPAN inputs because the CPAN default options are surprisingly dangerous. It now tries harder to execute the Perl helper files, previously these wouldn&apos;t be executed on some OSes. The helpers&apos; core logic has been abstracted into a wrapper library.

                        <li>
                          Improved plugins that use ERB by creating a new HelpfulERB class that provides sane behavior and provides friendly, contextual error messages making it much easier for users to identify and fix problems in templates.
